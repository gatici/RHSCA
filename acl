Allow davis (and only davis) to get full access to john‘s home directory.
setfacl -R -m u:davis:rwx /home/john


Create a directory named /common. Allow john and davis to share documents in the /common directory using a group called team. 
Both of them can read, write and remove documents from the other in this directory but any user not member of the group can’t.

mkdir /common
groupadd -g 50000 team
chgrp team /common
chmod 2770 /common
usermod -aG team john
usermod -aG team  davis
